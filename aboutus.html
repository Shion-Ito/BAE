                    Here at Texas A&M, we are proud to present one of the newest student-led organizations that connects students across all engineering fields. Brothers in Aggie Engineering aims to give our students convenient access to resources they need for personal success, which includes but are not limited to mentorship, community service, tutorials, and academic development. In keeping with the Aggie family core, we strive to forge the best version of our engineering program with a bright future ahead for all of our students.                    <br/>

                <em class = "warning">Unfortunately, due to unforeseen events of the Covid-19 virus outbreak, we have been forced to be sheltered and have not been able to do any large club activities. However, once freed from our cages we are planning to do many different things from tutoring sessions to club exclusive hackathons! Please be excited and ready for the Fall Semester!!!</em>
